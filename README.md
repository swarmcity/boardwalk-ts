# boardwalk-ts High Level Roadmap

## How to use this document
Every Episode is a development sprint. Each Episode consists of a set of Epics devs must work through in order to create the functionalities highlighted in the Episode.

After each sprint the dev team will show a functioning DApp demo in which the scenario described by the Episode is played out.

Once an Episode is completed, devs are free to move on to the ensuing Episode.
