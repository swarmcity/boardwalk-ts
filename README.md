At its core Swarm City is a blockchain based marketplace with a built in reputation system.
Swarm City uses blockchain technology and smart contracts to allow people to communicate and transact value, and earn contextual reputation.

The blockchain provides transparency, so users can safely interact with people they donâ€™t know, while keeping their private information to themselves. Smart contracts make sure interactions go as planned, and generate marketplace specific reputation for successful deals.
