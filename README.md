## How to use this document
Every Episode is a development sprint. Each Episode consists of a set of Epics devs must work through in order to create the functionalities highlighted in the Episode.

## S01 E01: First Request

In episode 1, Frank is really excited to start using Swarm City. Whenever he gets excited by something, Frank throws himself whole hog into it. And so without delay he creates and posts his first request.

Frank would like someone to translate his "Decentralise Now!" manifesto in exchange for 20 SWT. He posts this request in the marketplace known as #Settler, because #Settler is a place where early adopters go to do such things.

Frank is on /new-request, filling in the description: "Translate my 1 page manifesto from English to Dutch." and the amount: "20 SWT". Frank sets the request's location to "Worldwide". 

After submitting his request, he sees it on page /hashtag (of #Settler). Frank taps on his item to see the detail. In the detail, he finds and then grabs the shareable link and posts it on Facebook.

Who, oh who, will respond to Frank's request?

#### New epics in this episode:
- [ ] As a seeker, I can post a new request in a hashtag, describing what I am asking for and how much SWT I am offering,  so providers can see what my need is.


- [ ] As a user, I can see all the items in a hashtag, so I know the activity of myself and other people.


- [ ] As a user, I see the detail-view of a request/deal Iâ€™m active in so I can verify all the details of this request/deal.
